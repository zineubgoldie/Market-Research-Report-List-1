<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Human Tetanus Immune Globulin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injection</li><li>Freeze-dried Injection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Human Tetanus Immune Globulin market can be categorized into two main types: injection and freeze-dried injection. The standard injection form provides immediate passive immunity to individuals exposed to tetanus toxins, ensuring rapid protection. In contrast, freeze-dried injection offers a longer shelf life and stability, making it easier to store and transport. Both types serve the critical function of enhancing patient immunity against tetanus, especially in post-exposure scenarios, but differ in their preparation and handling requirements.</p></p>
